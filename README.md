# Assignment 3 SyntaxChecker
This is a delimiter Syntax Checker.

To use it compile the program.

If you have a file ready to upload you can enter the name in the command prompt. If you forgot to do that you will be prompted for a file.

Your code will be parced and the program will look for any miss matching delimiters. If there are any delimiter errors the program will tell you which line it was expecting a opening or closing delimiter.

The program will then close so you can fix your error!

If there are no errors you will be asked if you want to enter another file. Press 1 to do another or 2 to exit the program.

Happy Coding!
